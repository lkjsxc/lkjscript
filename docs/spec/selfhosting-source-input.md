# Canonical source carrier and reference closure

This is a bounded source-admission slice toward the
[semantic self-hosting contract](selfhosting.md). It carries current canonical
source objects, logical directories and a claimed semantic-state identity.
It contains no normalized instructions, inferred types, reference summaries,
validation certificates, compiled units or executable templates.

`source-graph::validate` admits the carrier, exact object bindings and logical
state. `source-links::validate` additionally resolves every supported owner and
type reference, including unused owners and untaken expression operands. Success
does not establish lexical scope, unique syntax ownership, acyclicity, expression
typing, affine custody, effects or witness validity. Source normalization and the
Tier 2 source-graph fixed point remain separate work.

The current carrier has one package and no dependencies or external blobs.
Recognized unsupported boundaries reject explicitly; importing a package's
interface or prior validation witness cannot supply its missing source bodies.
This carrier is separate from LKJCI1 profile 4, which retains its existing
backend input and output contract.

## Exact bytes

All scalar header fields and span fields are u32 little-endian. Complete input is
128 through 8,388,608 bytes. The sum of owner, type and retirement counts is at
most 100,000. Empty directories are allowed. Package identity is nonzero and the
package name has 1 through 128 canonical name bytes.

| Header offset | Width | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 8 | Magic `LKJSG001` |
| 8 | 4 | Complete actual byte length L |
| 12 | 4 | Owner count O |
| 16 | 4 | Type count T |
| 20 | 4 | Retirement count R |
| 24 | 4 | Package-name byte length |
| 28 | 4 | Dependency count, exactly zero in this slice |
| 32 | 16 | Package identity |
| 48 | 32 | Claimed current semantic-state digest |
| 80 | 4 | Owner-directory offset |
| 84 | 4 | Type-directory offset |
| 88 | 4 | Retirement-directory offset |
| 92 | 4 | Object-span directory offset |
| 96 | 4 | First canonical-object byte offset |
| 100 | 4 | Traversal allowance |
| 104 | 24 | Zero |

The name starts at offset 128. The three directories follow immediately, in
owner/type/retirement order. Their row formats are:

| Directory | Row width | Fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Owners | 50 | Current 17-byte OwnerKey, current 33-byte OwnerBinding |
| Types | 32 | Raw TypeObjectDigest |
| Retirements | 49 | Current 17-byte OwnerKey, raw RetirementObjectDigest |

Each directory is strictly increasing in its complete key. Duplicate keys and
reversed keys reject. The span directory follows these rows and contains O+T+R
pairs `(absolute_offset, byte_length)`. Its entries correspond to owners, types
and retirements in that order. Objects follow immediately in span order. Every
span must begin at the preceding span's end and the final span must end at L.
There is no padding, overlap, gap, aliasing or trailing data.

Traversal allowance must be at least
`4096 + 128*L + 1024*(O+T+R)` and at most 2,147,483,647. It is an input admission
condition distinct from VM instruction/allocation quotas and native process
limits. Bounds precede products, object access and hashing. Lookup uses binary
search over admitted immutable directories; it does not copy the complete source
or linearly rescan the directory for each reference.

## Binding and references

Each object must pass its current envelope/shape reader and independently derived
object digest. Owner and retirement records must agree with their directory's
exact identity and kind. A live owner cannot simultaneously be retired.

The compiler recomputes the logical owner and retirement map roots, the empty
dependency root, and the semantic-state digest from the actual package identity,
name and complete logical rows. It compares that digest with the header's claimed
state. Repository identity and physical map page locators do not enter this
semantic-state commitment. A digest match supplies no historical validation
certificate or execution authority.

The type directory contains content-addressed objects; its complete membership is
not a separate input to the kernel semantic-state digest. All supplied types are
still shape-checked, bound to their own digests and reference-checked. Adding a
valid unused type may therefore preserve the semantic-state digest while changing
the carrier bytes. The test receipt records a separate SHA-256 for complete
carrier identity; neither identity substitutes for validation. Reuse across inputs
must bind the complete carrier, not only the semantic-state digest; an additional
unused type can change reference closure without changing that state.

The reference pass reads original canonical record fields. Local typed identities
resolve in the exact owner directory and type digests in the exact type directory.
Package-qualified references must name the supplied package; a foreign package
cannot resolve by coincidentally matching a local identity. All included records
are visited, without selecting a root function or dropping unreachable syntax.

Retirement history fields are historical observations: their previous parent or
revision need not be a live source owner. Their canonical shape, directory
binding and separation from live owners are still checked.

| Diagnostic | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | The selected carrier/reference checks succeeded |
| 6 | Traversal allowance outside the admitted bounds |
| 12 | Malformed carrier, object encoding, ordering, binding or state commitment |
| 13 | Recognized unsupported source form or package/blob boundary |
| 14 | Missing or incompatible reference endpoint, or live/retired identity collision |

Binary-filter test entrypoints return the independently recomputed state
commitment on success and no bytes on rejection. Those entrypoints inspect source;
they do not compile or publish it. Tests serialize canonical objects without a
semantic preprocessing pass, compare with independent current codecs and logical
state expectations, and run on VM, reference and standalone native execution.
